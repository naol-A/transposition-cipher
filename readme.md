## 					Transposition cipher
### 		columnar, double and myszkowski cipher
***
a transposition cipher is a method of encryption by which the 
positions held by units of plaintext (which are commonly characters
or groups of characters) are shifted according to a regular system, 
so that the ciphertext constitutes a permutation of the plaintext.

* Columnar transposition cipher: the message is written out in rows 
of a fixed length, and then read out again column by column, and the 
columns are chosen in some scrambled order. 
* double transposition cipher: This is simply a columnar transposition 
applied twice.
* myszkowski transposition cipher
